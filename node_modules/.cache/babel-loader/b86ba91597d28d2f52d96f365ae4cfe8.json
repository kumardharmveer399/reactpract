THE PODS MOVES WITH ULTRA HIGH SPEED IN THE EVACUATED TUBE. IT IS AN ECO-FRIENDLY MODE OF TRANSPORTATION AS IT DOESN\\u2019T CONSUME FUEL. IN EVERY MODE OF TRANSPORT, AIR FRICTION AND AIR DRAG ARE THE BIGGEST SPEED LIMIT PROBLEM, BUT THE HYPERLOOP ALLEVIATES THESE PROBLEMS. IN THE HYPERLOOP SYSTEM, THE INNER SURFACE OF THE TUBE AND THE OUTER SURFACE OF THE PODS HAVE THE SAME MAGNETIC POLE THAT DRAWS THE POD INTO THE AIR AND ITS SPEED FROM AN EXTERNAL LINEAR ELECTRIC MOTOR AVAILABLE IN THE PODS. SOME LOW-PRESSURE AIR HAS NOT BEEN COMPLETELY SUCKED FROM THE PIPE. THE MOTOR IN FRONT OF THE PIPE ROTATES IN THE REVERSE DIRECTION SO THAT THE AIR TRAIL CAN BE USED AS A BRAKE.

IT IS MUCH SAFER THAN FLIGHTS.IT IS ESTIMATED THAT IT WILL COST 1/10 OF THE REGULAR RAILWAY TRACKS. IT WILL BE THE FASTEST ON LAND TRANSPORT. AS IT IS FREE FROM THE PROBLEMS LIKE AIR DRAG AND FRICTION, IT WILL COST LOW IN MAINTAINANCE THAT ENSURE IT WILL BE POCKET FRIENDLY. IT DOESN\\u2019T NEED MUCH POWER TO THAT OF OTHER TRANSPORT.
